# Sleeping Barber

A solution to the sleeping barber problem, using semaphores, for the Advanced Programming Techniques class.

Problem:
A barber has to shave 10 different people, but only one at a time and he needs to rest after shaving 4 people. When someone is being shaved all the others have to wait for their turn to be called by the barber. Only 4 people can be seated at the sofa so all the others have to wait at the hall until a seat at the couch is empty. Each person, as well as the barber is represented by a thread.

An executable .jar is included.
